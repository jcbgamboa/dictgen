What is this project?
=====================

This project is inspired by Jake McCrary's blog post
[Creating a custom Kindle dictionary](https://jakemccrary.com/blog/2020/11/11/creating-a-custom-kindle-dictionary/).
I can't believe I couldn't find a simple application that receives a .csv
file and produces a minimally working dictionary for my Kindle. So here I'll
make it. As in Jake McCrary's use case, I have my own list of words that I
want to turn into a dictionary.
